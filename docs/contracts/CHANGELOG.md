# Contracts — CHANGELOG

This index lists the changelogs for each contract family. Update the relevant versioned file whenever a contract changes.

- OpenAPI v1 — see docs/contracts/openapi/v1/CHANGELOG.md
- Events v1 — see docs/contracts/events/v1/CHANGELOG.md

Notes:

- Governance check in CI searches for the literal text "CHANGELOG.md" within docs/contracts to ensure a contract change is accompanied by a CHANGELOG update.
